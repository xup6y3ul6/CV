Research Assistant, "Neural correlates of emotion as an arbitrator to reconcile the conflicts within dual-process in the context of decision making under risk", Prof. Yung-Fong Hsu, March 2021, Present, "We studied the mechanism of dual-processing (heuristic and analytical) conflicts and the role of emotion when making a risky decision. I helped design the experiment of creating a 'Mixed Prospect Binary Lottery' to elicit the subject's utility functions and estimate the level of loss aversion."
Research Assistant, "Neural correlates of emotion as an arbitrator to reconcile the conflicts within dual-process in the context of decision making under risk", Prof. Yung-Fong Hsu, March 2021, Present, "We will utilize PET-fMRI and MRS-fMRI, the state-of-the-art neuroimaging techniques, to examine the effects of neurotransmitter and BOLD signals in a risky situation."
Research Assistant,"The cultural consensus theory extends with the threshold theory: A study of ordinal categorical data analysis", Prof. Yung-Fong Hsu, August 2019, July 2020,"We incorporated the Luceâ€‘Krantz threshold theory into cultural consensus theory to deal with ordinal categorical data. I axiomatized our new model and used the hierarchical Bayesian framwork for the inference."
Research Assistant,"From mind reading to mind sharing: A study on neural correlates of cognitive and affective ""Theory of Mind"" and their applications to salesforce enhancement", Prof. Heng-Chiang Huang, January 2018, December 2019, "We want to know if a seller has greater abilities of cognitive and affective Theory of Mind will they have a better selling performance. We designed two different games to test those abilities of Theory of Mind with fMRI and MEG."
Research Assistant,"From mind reading to mind sharing: A study on neural correlates of cognitive and affective ""Theory of Mind"" and their applications to salesforce enhancement", Prof. Heng-Chiang Huang, January 2018, December 2019, "I have played a critical role in this project by taking the initiative to learn Brainstorm (a MATLAB toolbox for M/EEG data analysis) and analyzing event-relative field and source estimation for our data. I also used the machine learning approach to classify the neural representation of numerosity (the set size of a group of items)"
Research Assistant,Coalition without trust: The intra-brain connectivity and inter-brain synchronization of herd behaviors in an economic bubble game, Prof. Yu-Ping Chen, January 2018, Present,"We observed pairs of subjects' stock trading behaviors in a simulated economic bubble game. The breakthrough in this project was that we connected two MRI scan machines and simultaneously collected both subjects' BOLD signals."
Research Assistant,Coalition without trust: The intra-brain connectivity and inter-brain synchronization of herd behaviors in an economic bubble game, Prof. Yu-Ping Chen, January 2018, Present,"I learned the fMRI analysis, established the analytical procedure, and recorded tutoring videos for our research team."
Learning Assistant,Research of positive and negative memorable tourism experience,Prof. Chia-Pin Yu, September 2016, January 2017, Assisted in data collection and qualitative interviews about the memorable tourism experience.
Research Assistant,Characteristics of the evapotranspiration of a Japanese cedar forest in Xitou in Taiwan,Researcher Sophie Laplace,February 2015,January 2016,Assisted in collecting the evapotranspiration data of tree sap flow in the Xitou experimental forest.
