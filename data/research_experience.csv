Research Assistant, "Neural Correlates of Emotion as an Arbitrator to Reconcile the Conflicts within Dual-Process in the Context of Decision Making under Risk", Prof. Yung-Fong Hsu, March 2021, Present, "We studied how the mechanism of people's dual-processing (heuristic and analytical) conflict when making a risky decision. The purpose of this study is to explore the role of emotion in the conflict of dual-processing decision-making. I helped design the experiment of creating a 'Mixed Prospect Binary Lottery' to simulate a risky scenario and estimate every subject's utility functions. Besides the behavioral experiments, we will conduct state-of-the-art neuroimaging, PET-fMRI and MRS-fMRI, in the future and examine the effects of neurotransmitter and BOLD signals under a risky situation."
Research Assistant,"The cultural consensus theory extends with the threshold theory: A study of ordinal categorical data analysis", Prof. Yung-Fong Hsu, August 2019, July 2020,"We incorporated the Luce‑Krantz threshold theory into cultural consensus theory to deal with ordinal categorical data. I axiomatized our new model and used Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling for Bayesian inference."
Research Assistant,"From mind reading to mind sharing: A study on neural correlates of cognitive and affective ""Theory of Mind"" and their applications to salesforce enhancement", Prof. Heng-Chiang Huang, January 2018, Present, "Under the supervision of Ph.D. candidate Jonathan Tong, we tried to measure the subject’s ability of cognitive and affective theory of mind. According to our experiment paradigm, we also probed into the topographic representation of numerosity on the brain."
Research Assistant,Coalition without trust: The intra-brain connectivity and inter-brain synchronization of herd behaviors in an economic bubble game, Prof. Yu-Ping Chen, January 2018, Present,"Under the supervision of Ph.D. candidate Jonathan Tong, I attended data collection and analyzed behavior and fMRI data. The breakthrough in this project was that we connected two MRIs and collected both subject's BOLD signals simultaneously."
